# kaggleFirstStepsWithJulia
My second project in kaggle (done in TensorFlow environment)
Based on used in the Udacity MOOC Deep Learning course.
The network consists of two convolutions, each followed by a RELU.
This was also an opportunity to monitor the training of the model with TENSORBOARD, some results are included at the bottom of the notebook.
The data is not included in this repository as it is available in the kaggle web site.
I submitted my results to kaggle only once and placed as 16th in the leaderboard at that time. I'm now at position 19th. 
I could get back to the project and work with bigger inputs (32X32 pixels) and add more information using using tools to randomly rotate and translate the images. But have not found time yet.
